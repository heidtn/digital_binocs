# digital_binocs
This hosts the project for a set of digital binoculars.  The goal is to create digital binoculars that are extendable in terms of software features.

Currently the binoculars are designed to work using a Raspberry Pi CM4.  They will be in a custom 3D printable enclosure that hosts a display and drivers.

The goal is to provide the following features:
- passthrough viewing to customizeable displays
- physical zoom
- digital zoom
- auto focus (depending on how afocal systems work)
- image stabalization
- image capture
- motion tracking
- motion enhancement
- object identification
- depth mapping
